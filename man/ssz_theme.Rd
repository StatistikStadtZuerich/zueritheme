\usage{
ssz_theme(
  grid_lines = "y",
  base_size = 8.2,
  base_family = "",
  base_line_size = base_size/170,
  base_rect_size = base_size/170,
  media = "print"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid_lines}{mandatory, specifies the axis on which to display the primary
grid lines or axis lines. For ggplot objects rendered with media = "print",
the default value is "y", meaning the main grid lines will appear on the Y-axis.
In contrast, for ggplot objects with media = "web", grid lines are not shown
explicitly. Instead, an axis line is displayed on the axis pecified by grid_lines,
effectively serving the role of grid lines in the plot.}

\item{base_size}{optional, defines the base font size used throughout the plot.
This parameter is passed to the ssz_theme_base and ssz_theme_base_web function,
ensuring consistent typography across ggplot elements. Adjust this value to
control the overall text size in the ggplot object for better readability or
stylistic preference.}

\item{base_family}{optional, specifies the base font family for the text elements
in the ggplot object. This parameter is passed to the ssz_theme_base and
ssz_theme_base_web function, ensuring a consistent font style across ggplot elements.
Adjust this value to control the overall font family in the ggplot object.}

\item{base_line_size}{optional, sets the base line size for lines and borders
within the ggplot object. This parameter is passed to the ssz_theme_base and
ssz_theme_base_web function, ensuring consistent line thickness across visual
elements. Adjust this value to modify the overall line width for improved visual
clarity or stylistic preferences.}

\item{base_rect_size}{optional, specifies the base size for rectangular elements
such as legend boxes or plot backgrounds within the ggplot object. This parameter
is passed to the ssz_theme_base and ssz_theme_base_web function, ensuring
consistent sizing of rectangular shapes across ggplot elements. Adjust this value
to control the thickness of borders for better visual balance or customization.}

\item{media}{mandatory, specifies the output medium for with the theme is
tailored. Available options are "print" and "web", with "print" as the default
value. This parameter controls how visual elements like grid lines and axis
formatting are adjusted to best suit the chosen medium, ensuring optimal
presentation for either print or web-based outputs.}
